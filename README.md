# Introduction

This is a test project to familiarize yourself with the basic capabilities of the Cassandra non-relational database.
The subject area of the test project was chosen randomly, the topic "Password storage system".
Project does not pretend to be truly correct solutions in the implementation of certain structures,
it was created solely for informational purposes
